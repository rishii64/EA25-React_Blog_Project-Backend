When Khan said, 'Jab taak Tiger maara nehi, tab taak Tiger haara nehi' (Until Tiger dies, Tiger is not defeated), really gives goosebumps and increases the anticipation for the trailer.Tiger 3, featuring one of the beloved on-screen pairs Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif, is the third installment of the famous spy series. The first two films, Ek Tha Tiger and Tiger Zinda Hai are considered to be massive hits at the box office, which is why there is a great expectation from the upcoming Tiger 3. We are expecting to have a glimpse of an interesting story in the trailer. Unlike previous films where Tiger fought villains, this film deals with the super spy facing a significant betrayal and being accused of being a traitor by his own nation.From the look of the teaser shared by YRF, we are expecting some power-packed music to complement the high-octane action sequences and the chemistry between Tiger and Zoya. The background music and some songs full of beats would make the film superior. ",

She said, “Finding individuals who have faith in actors who aren't A-listed stars can be challenging. While these actors might be talented, they aren't considered A-listers, and that's a fact. Making a film with an A-listed actor is a different scenario because it attracts more attention.”She further added, “However, it's commendable when a producer and director follow their instincts, have faith in us, and believe that we can pull it off. It gives actors like me hope that films like this can also be made with me in such roles.” ",

        desc: "While exercise is undoubtedly essential for overall health, its relationship with sleep has sparked a long-standing debate. One common question that often arises is whether exercising before bedtime can either help or hinder sleep quality. To shed light on the same, we spoke to Dr Pradeep Mahajan, Regenerative Medicine Researcher, and Founder, StemRx BioScience Solutions, India, who explained the science behind exercising before bed and its potential impact on your sleep.To understand the relationship between exercise and sleep, it's crucial to grasp the basics of the sleep cycle. Dr Mahajan said, “Sleep consists of several stages, including Rapid Eye Movement (REM) and non-REM phases. Deep, restorative sleep primarily occurs during the early part of the night, with REM sleep typically dominating later stages.”He added, “Exercise has been consistently linked to improved sleep quality. It can help reduce symptoms of insomnia and contribute to falling asleep faster. Regular physical activity is associated with better sleep, and people who engage in it often report fewer sleep disturbances. However, the timing of exercise can influence how it affects sleep.”According to a meta-analysis conducted by Sports Medicine (Auckland, New Zealand), which assessed 23 studies regarding evening exercise and its impact on sleep, it was found that evening physical activity can enhance sleep quality when performed at a moderate intensity, rather than a vigorous one, and ended more than an hour before bedtime.",

A brief jog can clear your mind, boost your self-esteem, and enhance overall cognitive function.Jogging engages various muscle groups, toning your legs, buttocks, and core. Weight-bearing exercises like jogging also promote bone density, reducing the risk of osteoporosis as you age.Regular physical activity, even in short bursts, promotes better sleep.

That is why knee pain can be a life-altering issue for many individuals, hindering their ability to stay active and fit. To exercise with knee pain, it's essential to understand the various knee disorders that can cause discomfort and adapt your workouts accordingly. Here are some workout tips tailored to different knee disorders:According to the Arthritis Foundation, 'Osteoarthritis was known as a wear and tear condition, generally associated with ageing. But we know now that it is a disease of the entire joint, and can degrade cartilage, change bone shape and cause inflammation, resulting in pain, stiffness and loss of mobility.'To manage knee pain associated with osteoarthritis, consider low-impact exercises like swimming, stationary cycling, and water aerobics. These activities are easier on the joints and can help improve mobility.PFPS, also called 'runner's knee' is used to describe pain in the kneecap, stated the American Academy Of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS). 'It is common in people who participate in sports, particularly females and young adults. But PFPS can occur in nonathletes, as well,' they added, sharing that the resulting pain and stiffness make it difficult to climb stairs, kneel down, and perform other everyday activities.If you are dealing with PPFS, focus on exercises that target the quadriceps and hamstrings, such as leg lifts and leg curls. Also, ensure you have proper footwear and a gradual increase in workout intensity.",

        title: "A strong core is vital to staying active. Here are three exercises that can help keep it in shape",
        desc: "Practically every move you make originates from one area of your body: the core.When you mention the core, most people think of the six-pack of abs, a muscle called the rectus abdominis. But the core is made up of abdominal, pelvic, and back muscles.Beside the rectus abdominis, the other main muscles include the external abdominal obliques, located on the side and front of your abdomen, and the internal abdominal obliques, which lie under the external obliques. A deeper layer called the transverse abdominis lies under the obliques and attaches to your spine.The core is vital for your body, as it serves as the foundation for upper- and lower-body movements, says Shawn Pedicini, a physical therapist with Harvard-affiliated Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital. Your core musculature must have a good combination of endurance, stability, and power for many activities. Your core is in action every day. For example, when you take a walk, your core muscles provide the support and endurance to maintain a healthy posture. Core strength allows you to transfer power during rotational movements, like swinging a golf club or tennis racket. Your core also generates stability around your spine to prevent back injuries, like when you lift and carry heavy objects. Core strength is also essential for preventing falls. Our bodies constantly have to adapt to ever-changing surfaces and environments, says Pedicini. Adequate core stability and strength can assist you in reacting to sudden changes and prevent falls.",

        desc: "Whether you were once much more physically active or have never been one to exercise regularly, now is a great time to start an exercise and Fitness regimen. Getting and staying in shape is just as important for seniors as it is for younger people. Why is exercise important for older people? Getting your heart rate up and challenging your muscles benefits virtually every system in your body and improves your physical and mental health in myriad ways. Physical activity helps maintain a healthy blood pressure, keeps harmful plaque from building up in your arteries, reduces inflammation, improves blood sugar levels, strengthens bones, and helps stave off depression. In addition, a regular exercise program can make your sex life better, lead to better quality sleep, reduce your risk of some cancers, and is linked to longer life. Many older adults hesitate to get moving because they’re unfamiliar with the types of exercise and Fitness that are effective and safe, and aren’t sure how much exercise they need to do. The good news is that any kind of movement is better than being sedentary, so there’s nothing wrong with starting small and working your way up to longer workouts. Your goal should be no less than 150 minutes of moderate intensity activity per week, but if you can’t start at that level, work up to it (and then past it). While there are many dedicated forms of exercise and Fitness for adults, you also want to stay physically active throughout the day by taking the stairs, doing yard work, and playing with your grandkids. When it comes to exercise and Fitness for seniors, most can begin without consulting a doctor—but there are exceptions. If you have a major health condition like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart or lung disease, osteoprosis or a neurological disease, definitely talk to your doctor first. People with mobility issues such as poor balance or arthritis should also get advice from their doctor. ",

Her whole-grain boosted sourdough crust caught my attention. I also didn't need convincing related to the garlic-spiked labneh slathered beneath summery toppings. I don't need to tell most of you, as I initially typed this, we were a long way from summer.Sarah's galette was loaded with beautiful tomatoes, but by the time I spotted her recipe, tomatoes were long gone for the year. My tart needed to be more of a cold weather affair, and the delicata squash and shallots I had on hand seemed a natural evolution. I've baked this galette four or five times since, and it's omg-so-good. If you love savory tarts this is for you. And please don't sweat it if you don't maintain a sourdough starter, I'll note a couple alternative paths you can take down below.This galette is a bit of a project if you start from zero at late in the evening with dinner as your intention. Pre-make most of the components when you have a few minutes here or there in the days prior, and it will come together effortlessly when you're ready to bake the finale.",

It was the show-stopping centerpiece of a meal flanked by a beautiful winter green + chicory salad and gem-shaded glasses of wine. The combination of bubbling cubes of brothy bread and caramelized onions silkily merging with molten threads of cheese is knee-buckling. It’s the perfect example of a short list of the simplest ingredients coming together into something much more than then sum of their parts.I’ve baked variations of this panade in the years since, and it never disappoints. It’s endlessly adaptable, meaning that you can add seasonal ingredients to suit your fancy. For example, in my case, I do a vegetarian version by switching up the broth, and I like my onions on the caramelized side of the spectrum. I’ll add whatever sautéed greens or roasted vegetables I have around. Judy also listed a range of ideas and variations in the cookbook, so if you have it (and you should!) be sure to have a glance at those for year-round inspiration. Her original had chard. I use lots of scallions in mine. In short, it’s one of those IYKYK recipes. Molly Wizenberg knew what was up way back in 2005 when she wrote about the Judy panade recipe here.",

Particularly ones with a strong point of view, thoughtful design, and inspired recipes. In that spirit, I have a gem to share with you this afternoon. It is a light-hearted little cookbook titled Martha Goes Green, created by a media-savvy trio of friends in Melbourne, Australia. The book includes a recipe for these sunflower seed and spinach-flecked pumpkin feta muffins. Savory muffin fans, you know who you are, these don't disappoint.When I spent a month traveling around New Zealand a few years back, it became clear that New Zealand is the land of the A+ muffin. Scones too, but muffins in particular. There were lots of savory versions to choose from, but my favorites always had winter squash in them. If this book is any indication, I suspect Australia might be similar. Anyhow, these muffins are exactly the sort of thing I crave and remember from that trip. I love the kick of black pepper here, and the blend of cheese. It's not quite pumpkin season here, so I substituted butternut squash. But really, just about any winter squash will do.The recipes have an accessible, achievable vibe to them and I have the vegetarian pho, satay curry, stir fried noodles, and lentil mushroom moussaka earmarked to try next. The book doesn't seem to be available anymore (it has been over a decade), but you can still check in on some of the recipes here and here on Rosie's site.",

You could do a spicy version by adding a dollop of harissa to the sauce, or some chile flakes, or a tablespoon of toasted sesame chile oil.

There is a wide range of brands around, so you'll need to experiment. My advice on this front is to 'date around' until you find a few brands and shapes you like. For day to day pasta eating when you compare nutritional labels, the noodles made with more whole ingredients can deliver significantly more vitamins, minerals, fiber, protein and the like.

        desc: " A vegetarian take on the Chinese chicken salad of my youth. Toss shredded lettuces and cabbage, lots of cilantro, green onions, and the protein of your choice with a strong sesame-soy dressing punctuated with the bite of hot mustard. Forever one of my favorite salads.This has been an evolving recipe over the past twenty years and I think it *finally* nails all the notes I love in a great Chinese chicken salad. Specifically, it's a vegetarian take on what I think of as the amazing Chinese chicken salads of my youth, circa the 1980s. This version includes all my favorite components - the awesome super-strong hot mustard & sesame-soy dressing, the pile-it-on approach to cilantro, the scallions and toasted nuts. Then, with this version, you introduce some sort of alternate protein (or plant-based chicken). The whole situation is compiled into a feathery, light mountain of deliciousness.In place of shredded chicken, in the traditional version, you have options. I’ll be honest and say, I’m not a huge fan of the highly-processed plant-based meats available, but there is one brand of plant-based chicken Wayne buys on occasion. This one - green bag, original (*not sponsored). I occasionally reach for it, especially in a recipe like this one, when I’m really chasing the nostalgia. Anyway, it’s the best I’ve tasted. Alternately, if you’re willing to let go of the chicken angle - a hard-boiled egg, or a bit of pan-fried tofu is all you need to make a one bowl meal of things.",

Fresh flowers are finding their way back into Mason jars, and the avalanche of mail is, quite honestly, being ignored. Travel time from our apartment in Testaccio to our front door in San Francisco: twenty hours. Twenty. Hours. It hurts to even type that. After travel like this I end up craving extra-wholesome Food for days after arriving home. This time, my first day back, I turned out a super satisfying lunch inspired by two recipes, including the Raw Tuscan Kale Salad, in Melissa Clark's cookbook - In the Kitchen with A Good Appetite.So, it is a salad I threw together for a casual lunch, but can also imagine making for friends or family. I can imagine endless ways you might work it into a one-dish meal. Make a bit of extra dressing, add some farro to the mix, and top with a poached egg, for example. Or, incorporate some roasted winter squash alongside the kale. Or, do a more finely chopped version before folding every thing into a bowl of seasoned quinoa. I ate the salad alongside Melissa's Mustard and Pickle-spiked Tofu Salad served on toasted poppy seed wheat bread. At that moment, few things would have tasted better.I doubled up on the breadcrumbs here, because who doesn't like a bit of extra crunch? This is reflected in the recipe below. And for those of you without access to pecorino, freshly grated Parmesan is a reasonable substitute.",

I totally do,” Lawrence said. “I’m not sure everybody does, but I definitely do.”He also noted that the team agreed at the time that the two halves of Mockingjay, which were released in theaters a year apart, “had their own separate dramatic questions,” which made for complete arcs. But he also acknowledged why some fans weren’t too happy with the long waiting period between the films.“What I realized in retrospect — and after hearing all the reactions and feeling the kind of wrath of fans, critics and people at the split — is that I realized it was frustrating,” Lawrence said. “And I can understand it.”But the director also added that it was nice being able to adapt more from the books by breaking it up into two parts.“In truth, we got more on the screen out of the book than we would’ve in any of the other movies because you’re getting close to four hours of screen time for the final book,” he explained.As for his upcoming prequel The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, which arrives in theaters on Nov. 17, Lawrence said the intention was always to make one movie from Suzanne Collins’ book that was published in 2020, even if it meant for a longer run time.",

        desc: "After a nearly six-month search that featured thousands of candidates, newcomers Ian Cardoni and Harry Belden now find themselves squarely in the spotlight after they officially made their debut as the voices of the narcissistic, alcoholic genius Rick and his bumbling grandson Morty, respectively, in the season seven premiere of the Adult Swim animated hit.Sunday's premiere marked the first episode of Rick and Morty without co-creator Justin Roiland, who until now had voiced both characters (among others) for all of the show’s 61 previous episodes. Roiland was fired from the cult hit and saw his Hollywood empire implode after allegations of domestic violence surfaced and reports, including in The Hollywood Reporter, uncovered years of his allegedly troubling behavior. An Orange County District Attorney dismissed the domestic violence charges, citing insufficient evidence and has also denied new allegations of misconduct that ranges from sexual harassment to sexual assault.For Rick and Morty showrunner Scott Marder, who led the casting search, the goal was clear: To make the change as seamless as possible so viewers — who knew about the behind-the-scenes drama as well as those who didn’t — couldn’t notice a difference in the two beloved characters. Marder and co-creator Dan Harmon both see the additions of Cardoni and Belden as a way to add years to the show’s lifespan after the decision was made to use two voices rather than one for both Rick and Morty.",

In a rare move, the host addressed the audience before the title sequence aired on Sunday’s show.“Without all the music and the lights and — at least theoretically — the laughter, I wanted to briefly talk to you about what has clearly been a terrible week,” he began. “The immense suffering in Israel and Gaza has been sickening to watch, and we’re not gonna be covering it in the main body of our show tonight for a couple of reasons. First, it’s horrific. I don’t really want to tell jokes about carnage right now, and I’m pretty sure that you don’t want to hear them. And second, we’re taping this on Saturday afternoon and you’ll be watching it Sunday night or Monday morning through an illegal VPN. I do know who I’m talking to,” he quipped.He played an interview between CNN’s Jake Tapper and Noi Katzman, whose brother Chaim was killed last weekend in the Hamas terrorist attacks. Katzman ended his interview by saying he didn’t want his brother’s death to “be used to kill innocent people. … I don’t want anything to happen to people in Gaza like what happened to my brother, and I’m sure he wouldn’t have any either. So that’s my call to my government to stop killing innocent people. And that’s not the way that brings us peace and security to people in Israel.”",

It was really, really great.”Evans added that the couple had two ceremonies: “We had one on the East Coast. We did one in Portugal. My wife’s Portuguese.”He also went on to explain how stressful the planning process of weddings can be, saying, “For those of you who are married, it takes a lot out of you.”But Evans noted that now that he and his wife are “through that, we’ve kinda just been enjoying life, gearing up for autumn. It’s the best time of year right now. Now we’re just relaxing and enjoying life and reflecting.”During the 30-minute Saturday panel, Evans — who also spoke about his rescue dog Dodger and his work in the animal advocacy space — also addressed whether he’d consider returning to Broadway. The actor admitted he “very much so” would consider returning to the stage and is looking in terms of stage plays, but he hasn’t “quite found it yet.”“It has to be something that you are deeply passionate about, so I’m looking. I’d love to actually try and find something next year, but it’s tough because you’ll find something that you are kind of into that could be cool, but there’s just — like I said, once you’re in it, you are in,” he said. “Theater, they usually want three, four or five months. It’s got to be something that you don’t just love, but something that you’re ready to explore from different angles every single night for a very long time.” Evans shared that like many actors he started in high school theater, doing “a lot of Shakespeare,” with another notable Hollywood actor. “I went to high school and Jeremy strong — I don’t know if anyone knows that — and we both did a lot of Shakespeare shows together as teenagers,” Evans said. “With Jeremy Strong, I was just trying to keep up.” As for whether Evans would dip his toe into the musical space, he’s “not a good enough singer” to try it on the stage, but would consider it for the screen. “I could do a film musical because that you can do in a studio, and you can polish it until it’s right,” he said. “To get up there and just do it every day, eght times a week? I don’t have the pipes. I wish I did.”",

A description from the publisher describes it as “a memoir from one of the major influences on modern comedy (and Emmy, Golden Globe, and Peabody Award-winner), detailing his lifelong relationship with the craft, his work on iconic projects such as Seinfeld, Curb Your Enthusiasm and Borat, as well as highlighting collaborations with everyone from Mel Brooks to Bob Dylan to Bill Maher to Megan Thee Stallion and Bowen Yang.”Though currently untitled, Charles shared one idea during a recent wide-ranging interview: Life is But a Joke, from the Bob Dylan song “All Along the Watchtower.” (Dylan is another collaborator of Charles’, co-writing Charles’ 2023 movie Masked and Anonymous.) After a stint joke-writing in 1970s Los Angeles, Charles quickly made a name for himself in the comedy world — first teaming with Larry David on sketch comedy series Fridays before going on to write for Seinfeld and direct Curb Your Enthusiasm. Directing proved to be a smart pivot, as he famously helmed Sacha Baron Cohen films Borat and Brüno. A24’s Dicks: The Musical is currently in theaters.This is not Charles’ first book. In 1988, he and the late Richard Belzer teamed up for the comical self-help guide How to Be a Stand-Up Comic.The deal was brokered by UTA co-head of publishing Byrd Leavell and is for TMR",

For those reasons, I will only be reading a small part of my audiobook. I am so grateful to the amazing Michelle Williams for reading the rest of it.”The five-time Oscar-nominated actress said, “I stand with Britney.” This is the first audiobook Williams, who has starred in Manchester by the Sea, My Week with Marilyn, Blue Valentine and Fosse/Verdon, has narrated. The Woman in Me, which was written with “candor and humor” is described as a “brave and astonishingly moving story about freedom, fame, motherhood, survival, faith and hope.” It also “illuminates the enduring power of music and love — and the importance of a woman telling her own story, on her own terms, at last.” In the book, Spears discusses her 13-year conservatorship and how the case impacted her personally and publicly. In November 2021, a Los Angeles County judge ruled to terminate the conservatorship after the singer testified in court months prior that it was abusive and that it was her “wish and my dream for this to end.” The memoir, which was previously reported to be worth as much as $15 million, was acquired by Gallery Books following a bidding war involving several publishers.

Many firms are jostling with each other, offering designs that range from scaled-up multirotor drones, via things which resemble rigid spiders’ webs, to fixed-wing/helicopter hybrids. None of these, however, will be Jetson-like family saloons with dad (or even mum) at the controls. Those flying them will require a pilot’s licence. Most will probably be used initially as sky-going taxis.One company has, by contrast, stuck to its guns and carried through its original project to create something which people can purchase and pilot themselves. Helix is a single-seat vehicle, so “flying motorbike” might be a more accurate appellation. It has, however, been carefully crafted by its maker, Pivotal, based in Silicon Valley, to be within America’s rules for microlight aircraft. That means anyone, pilot’s licence or not, can fly it over non-built-up areas. As a result, from next year those with $190,000 stuffed down the back of the sofa will be able to order one for personal use—though they will not be able to take delivery until June.",

This case is part of a wider string of legal cases facing tech companies over generative AI, including several pending US lawsuits.Since these models use massive amounts of data from the internet for training, most cases revolve around the misuse of content without approval, including personal information, books, and visual art.Mounting legal issues could hinder the development and adoption of the Technology, not just for Google but across the industry. The outcomes of these early generative AI cases are still unclear, but preliminary indications suggest that courts are approaching generative AI claims with a healthy level of scepticism.",

According to the company, posts written on Facebook and Instagram by Hamas, labeled a terrorist organisation by several Western governments, are considered in contravention of its Dangerous Organisations and Individuals Policy. Yet, despite the group being banned from posting on these platforms, Meta continues to remove hundreds of thousands of posts in praise or support of Hamas. Three days following the October 7 attack, these posts numbered close to 800,000, seven times the removal rate just two months prior. Meta has also ramped up its defenses by establishing:A special operations centre staffed with linguists versed in Arabic and Hebrew.Stronger steps to prevent the posting of violent content in the first place.An expansion of the Violence and Incitement Policy to prioritise the safety of hostages.Restricted access to specific hashtags associated with violent contentBlurring of the face of victims posted on the platforms. Other platforms like X took similar actions in the wake of a call for greater platform moderation from organisations such as the European Union, the Arab Centre for the Advancement of Social Media, and the Anti-Defamation League. Conversely, the Association for Progressive Communications decried the heavy-handed approach to censoring Palestinians’ speech.  Why does it matter?Meta’s swift and decisive action amidst this crisis is well noted, given the pummelling the platform operator faced for its role in the promotion of disinformation, misinformation, and hate speech during other offline conflicts.

During the initial phases of the digital ID system, issues include low uptake due to data privacy fears, service access limitations, and a lengthy wait time to replace the access PIN or the card itself. In recent times, users have complained of an inability to access the digital certificates linked to the digital IDs, failings with renewals, the wrong linking of IDs to bank accounts and administrative records, and a lack of inter-agency communication. As the government works feverishly to solve the ongoing setbacks with the My Number ID system, public opinion point to the need for greater and deeper sensitisation on the project as being at the heart of the problems.

        desc: "Australia is amid an ongoing debate over new laws that could finally bring the country’s national digital identity scheme to fruition. As progress on the national digital ID plan remains slow, financial institutions seek alternative solutions and turn to private identity services. The Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), one of the country’s largest banks, has recently partnered with ConnectID. This digital identity service enables users to prove their identity online to businesses and merchants. This development follows the National Bank of Australia (NAB), which previously allowed customers to access ConnectID. CBA plans to utilize ConnectID to allow its customers to verify their identity using face biometrics through the CBA app.ConnectID is a product of collaboration between AP+ (Australian Payments Plus), Eftpos (a digital identity solutions company), BPAY (a payments platform), and the New Payments Platform (NPP), a subsidiary of AP+. It is designed as an alternative to government digital ID schemes, primarily aimed at consumers. The service features data minimization as one of its essential aspects. Why does it matter? ConnectID is the first non-government operator accredited by the Australian government under the Trusted Digital Identity Framework (TDIF) to provide digital identity exchange services in the country. The federal government has actively encouraged private sector participation in the TDIF since 2018. However, the latest move suggests that banks may be growing impatient with government schemes. Experts in the field warn against the rushed passage of the Identity Verification Services Bill 2023, which aims to regulate identity verification services and establish the foundation for the country’s upcoming digital identity ecosystem, alongside other forthcoming laws, such as the draft Digital ID Bill.",

        desc: "According to recently proposed plans of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which establishes standards for traditional finance institutions, banks will be required to fully disclose their cryptocurrency holdings. This move comes as international regulators attribute some banking collapses to the rapid rise in the popularity of cryptocurrencies.The Committee had previously recommended that banks should allocate sufficient capital to account for their holdings of unsupported cryptocurrencies like bitcoin (BTC) or ether (ETH). The new disclosure obligations for banks’ crypto-asset exposure will complement the existing capital requirements for digital assets.In a report released on Thursday, the Committee outlined its perspective on what it referred to as the ‘most noteworthy system-wide banking stress’ since the 2008 financial crisis, with cryptocurrency being targeted. The surge in popularity of cryptocurrency was identified as one of three underlying trends indirectly contributing to the financial disruption in traditional finance that occurred in March, along with the expansion of non-bank financial intermediation and the emergence of faster digital payment systems enabling rapid depositor withdrawals.About the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is an international committee of banking supervisory authorities established by the central bank governors of the Group of Ten countries in 1974. Its objective is to enhance understanding of key supervisory issues and improve the quality of banking supervision worldwide. The committee frames guidelines and standards in different areas – some of the better known among them are the international standards on capital adequacy, the Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision and the Concordat on cross-border banking supervision. The committee is made up of central banks and other banking regulatory authorities from 28 jurisdictions and has 45 members.",

        desc: "A Kenyan parliamentary panel has recommended the shutdown of Worldcoin in the country due to concerns about the ‘authenticity and legality’ of its operations in the digital identity, financial services, and data security domains. An ad hoc committee of 18 legislators was set up in August to scrutinise the activities of Worldcoin, Sam Altman’s crypto venture. The lawmakers called on Kenya’s ICT regulator, the Communication Authority, to ban Worldcoin’s physical and virtual presence, including blocking the IP addresses of related websites, until relevant rules on digital assets are in place in the country. The panel also urged the government to immediately take action and launch criminal probes into ‘Tools for Humanity Corp’, a company co-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman to produce Worldcoin, and its Kenyan partners, including Sense Marketing. The report should be presented and discussed soon at the Kenyan National Assembly.Why does it matter? The lawmaker’s report highlights several pending issues with digital identity and data privacy in the crypto industry. The recommendations come as Kenya ordered Worldcoin to stop all registration in the country in early August as a result of complaints about Worldcoin’s biometric scan of users’ iris in exchange for a digital ID linked to a new ‘identity and financial network’. In total disregard for the government’s order, Worldcoin kept on collecting Kenya’s residents’ personal data virtually, with no age verification process. In addition to the shutdown of the operation, the recommendations include: ‘implementing a comprehensive framework for digital assets and virtual asset service providers; amending existing regulations to consider cybercrimes and tax reporting requirements; and providing a requirement for full disclosure on how companies will utilize and store personal and sensitive data collected in Kenya.’ Worldcoin has also come under the radar of British, German, and French regulators. A shutdown would restrict Worldcoin’s development plans and could impact its reputation, set a precedent, and inspire other countries to follow Kenya’s legislative action.",

        desc: "Public libraries have lent e-books to patrons for more than 20 years, but many have widened their electronic offerings with digital audiobooks, magazines, comics, videos and other services, even before the pandemic helped shift collections online. If you are curious about what your local library can lend from its digital shelves but never got around to signing up for a free library card — or connecting your existing card to an account — here’s how to get started. Locate Your Library: If you are not sure where to find your nearest library, search online or enter your town’s name into the Library Finder website or the “Find Libraries and Archives” page at USA.gov. Once you find a library, check its website for information about signing up for a library card and the possibility of borrowing e-books and other materials. Links to “Digital Collections” or “Online Resources” or even “Get a Library Card” on the library’s home page should get you started. Libraries have varying requirements for a card. Some may allow you to fully sign up online; others may want proof of your address from uploaded documents, phone numbers or geolocation data; and some libraries prefer you sign up for a library card in person at the nearest branch.If you do not have a nearby branch, some city libraries allow anyone living in the state to sign up for a card, so check the residency requirements. The Brooklyn Public Library, the New York Public Library and the Queens Public Library systems allow people who live, work, pay property taxes or attend school in the state of New York to get a card. Statewide libraries exist beyond New York, like the Free Library of Philadelphia, which is open to Pennsylvania residents, and the Houston Public Library, which serves most Texans. Once you complete the sign-up process for a library card, you get a user name or number, as well as a PIN or passcode to log into the library’s site.",
